Climate.R involves getting raw bioclimatic data.  
The raw files are far too large to put on github. 
Subsequent scripts can be run without the user running Climate.R.  

Run:

1) Coordinates.R
2) SweeD.R
3) Allele_Freq.R 
4) Correlation.R

All input, intermediate, and output files are in the repository.  

Throughout the scripts, the user will need to replace 
"/Users/richiehodel/Desktop/" with the directory/path where 
the user puts the repository "Amborella_ENM"
